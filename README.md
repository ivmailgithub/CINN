Combinatorial Informed Neural Network aka pinnnns on a l-o-t-t-e-r-y urnnn model w/o replacement

so some typos to avoid key word search hits .. i think 1/4 of all network hits are now ai engines/agents probing the internet  .. this feels like a bad 1970's tv now.... i need a used car now too...

In claude:
  a pinn transformer model: physics informed neural network using the fluid flow equations (volterra/Stokes/) is now a standard in aerodynamic simulations. Is there a combinatoric informed neural network to train on data from a urn model w/o replacement? hypergeometric distribution is known; the urn model draws are random against that dist ... your training on that data to determine a range of next state draws on that urn model. write a pytorch transformer model for that prediction
  
In google aistudio console which is gemini3.5-pro-preview: same thing prompt but this time ask for tensorflow python code

in copilot a lot of gibberish .. but i'm only on the browser maybe the paid-for-chatgpt access is different .. i almost never use copilot except in vs2022/25

pytorch is on cuda13.0 but tf is back to ancient py and cuda 11....  try a wslub24 conda shell for that one.

toolcalling for current paper references is neat but some of the refs look strange.  google must be all stanford guys it will ref last Monday's urn prob talk but not the actual content just the poster announcement...so why is that a reference in this tool search? claude is shorter but again the tool agent is searching papers in 2025 even if they are iffy...

as always mrphelps if your caught or ki.... published ai generated slop will lead to model collapse and the end of the universe and we will disclaim any knowledge and blame the trumper's...

working on a data loader now for the two provided scripts
i will say in the past 20 years i've spent months writing web spiders to gather data ... in claude the spiders were rewritten in an hour..sure i remembered to set a primarykey to prevent duplicate rows in duckdb .. but otherwise 1 hour done ... not months of tuning html tag regex's; and rewriting them every few years...

oh i got about 10million rows... of 80/20 urn model draws..
